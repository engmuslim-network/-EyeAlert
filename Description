"EyeAlert" – A Smart Driver Drowsiness Detection System

EyeAlert is an innovative safety system designed to monitor a driver's alertness and detect signs of drowsiness in real-time. The system uses a camera pointed at the driver’s face, along with computer vision algorithms, to track eye movements and detect whether the eyes are open or closed. If the driver’s eyes remain closed for a critical duration, the system triggers a loud audible alert to prevent potential accidents caused by falling asleep at the wheel.

This non-intrusive solution does not require the driver to wear any equipment, making it highly practical and easy to integrate into any type of vehicle. It offers an affordable and effective way to enhance road safety, particularly during long trips or nighttime driving.
